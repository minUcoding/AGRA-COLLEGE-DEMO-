                    Organizing a one-day colloquium on "Role of scientists in freedom movement" (26.09.2023)

Under the Pandit Gangadhar Shastri Memorial Lecture Series, a one-day symposium on the topic "Role of Scientists in the Freedom Movement" was organized by Vigyan Bharti Braj Province in the Seminar Hall of Agra College today, in which speaking as the keynote speaker, Shri Shreyansh Mandloi, Regional Organization Minister of Vigyan Bharti Uttar Pradesh, highlighted the important role of Indian scientists in making the country independent.

Shri Mandloi further said that while on one hand the revolutionaries fought directly with the British, on the other hand the scientists of our country fought with the British government at every level on the basis of their scientific capabilities. He said that it was always propagated that science in India was a gift of the British, whereas science and technology have been used in India since the Vedic period. We were world leaders in many fields like Aeronautics, Nadi Shastra, Astrology, Astronomy, Metallurgy, Medical Science etc.

He said that during the freedom movement, Surendranath Bose established an organization like 'Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science' in 1876 to promote scientists in the country and create a large intellectual class. Through this organization, scientists like CV Raman, JC Bose could showcase their abilities. The aim of the organization was to prepare patriotic scientists. Professor PC Ray established Bengal Chemicals in 1902 and wrote the book 'The Hindu Chemistry' and told that we knew about chemistry for centuries. He also established many industries in the country. Shri Mandloi said that with time we stopped competing, as a result we lagged behind in various fields, which the British took full advantage of. They used science to expand their empire.

Special speaker of the conversation Agra College Principal Prof. Anurag Shukla said that civilization develops through science. We are the children of those who have science in their veins. We have gradually forgotten science. The British broke the scientific tradition of India.

The program was presided over by State President Prof. Manoj Kumar Rawat and General Secretary Dr. Sandhya Agarwal thanked the guests. It was conducted by Dr. Yashasvita Chauhan.

Before this, the guests formally started the conversation by lighting a lamp in front of the picture of Goddess Saraswati.
